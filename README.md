OBDuino-mega
============

This is a port of the OBDuino32K project for use on an Arduino MEGA 2560.

The original project can be found at [google code](http://code.google.com/p/opengauge/)

Because of the Mega's larger code and data size, I am also using a 
[TFT display/Touchscreen](https://www.adafruit.com/products/335) combo from Adafruit. 
They were kind enough to provide a library to use their display, so I use that as well.
